We're going to use GitHub's direct editor to simulate that process now. Normally, we don't edit files directly in GitHub, but we'll do that here in order to simulate another developer pushing a commit to the central repository.

Change the text in the file, then at the bottom of the screen enter a commit message in the first field of the Commit Changes box. Then, Click the Commit Changes button at the bottom of the screen.

Just like we did in Part II, open up GitHub and modify the text in the sample.txt file, making sure you commit the changes.
